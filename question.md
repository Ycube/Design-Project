### I.  What is your favorite project you have worked on?
> [Trippian](https://github.com/trippian/trippian), it's a platform to connect tourist and travelers to local companions who live there and offer themselves as tourguides. 

### II.  What did you contribute to this project? 
> Mainly backend engineer, which includes using neo4j, restful APIs, facebook authentication with [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/), edited video for splash page and worked with css to create color designs


### III.  What were some of the challenges you faced?
> Waterfall VS. Agile Development. During the Trippian project, I thought we started working in a agile development process, however it ended up being waterfall development. We should've used an agile technique because every point along the way, we never had a MVP until towards the end. Because of this, it was very difficult to connect all of the different features along the way.
